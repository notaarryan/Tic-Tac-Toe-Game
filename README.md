<h3>Project:Tic Tac Toe</h3>
<p>This project is a part of my journey towards becomeing a full stack developer.</p>
<p>I am creating projects related to the languages i just learned to strengthen my grip on that language</p>
<p>This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game project.</p>
<p>The live version of the game is here <a href="https://notaarryan.github.io/Tic-Tac-Toe-Game">here</a>.</p>
<p>I have not tried my best to make the website responsive yet but might work on it later.</p>
